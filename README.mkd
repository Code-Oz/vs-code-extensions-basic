## **Basic typescript for developping vs code extension**

You just need to run 

```console
npm install
```

For dev purposes:

```console
npm run dev
```

To test it in dev mode you need to go to `extension.ts` press F5, use `vs-code dev`

Then a new window appear, you will need to run the command (`CMD+Shift+P` or `CRTL+Shift+P`) and enter your command (basically `hello`)

For Prod purposes:

```console
npm run compile
```
